			"me": "I currently work as a software engineer in...warm sunny Colorado! I love tea, particularly Japanese green tea, and pottery. I'm trying to merge the two with Cardano and hopefully something great will come out of it.",
			"server": "All of SNCHA's nodes are running enterprise grade drives in RAID 1 on bare-metal. Relay nodes are supplied with redundant internet access via a failover router and all nodes and networking equipment are provided with constant power through uninterruptible power supplies (UPS). The only part of SNCHA's setup that runs on a VPS is a VPN that keeps the WAN facing IP static, but should this fail the relay's IP's would be updated dynamically. I strive to keep SNCHA's nodes online 100% of the time, keep each node up to date with the latest version of the node from IOHK, and maintain the decentralization of the network.",
			"company": "Sencha stakepool is the official pool of Cellar Door Studio, a small business run by my wife and I. We sell pottery, tea, and fiber arts. We're currently pretty small and I have very little time to spend in my studio but hopefully managing a stakepool will provide some extra income and in turn free up extra time for art."
