			"me": "banderini has been involved in Cardano since its inception and cryptocurrency in general since the early days of bitcoin.  The shared ownership of blockchains is a new model of enterprise which is poised to change everything about how the world works today and the opportunities for improving our societies are already available. We donate 10% of operator profits to charities working with the homeless and refugees.  banderini delegators have exclusive access to a real-time dashboard, showing historical rewards, projected returns, the pool's minting progress, and more.  As an example, the SPO dashboard is at https://insights.banderini.net/banderdash/stake1u8fhuzhxyq53de2h4f3msyy9jmmyzs6e5kv9sdpnnyp2aasdwl8p2.",
			"server": "banderini nodes are geographically dispersed and architected for zero downtime during upgrades or failure events. banderini nodes will never miss a block. Core nodes operate on private networks and management layers are closed off from the internet, so the pool is secure by design. Infrastructure is monitored 24/7 and performance is constantly being evaluated. There are live dashboards available at http://blackbird.banderini.net - to toggle dashboards, click on 'banderini' in the top left corner of the page.",
