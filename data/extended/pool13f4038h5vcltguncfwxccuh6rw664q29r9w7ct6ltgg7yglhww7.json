			"company": "We are passionate about Non-Profits. Having run and contributed to many ourselves, we believe in your cause â€“ and we are prepared to support you in every way. We are passionate about Cryptocurrencies, the decoupling they offer from any government or agenda-managed control of fiat currencies, and the freedom they offer. However, after participating in Bitcoin, Etherium, and others for years, we believe the scientific approach, with ground-up foundational design incorporating lessons learned and best practices, is the right approach - and Cardano is the network that is doing it. We back their efforts to democratize currencies, and free us from the yoke of human agenda-based controls. Our business model offers services to get normal people and businesses into the Crypto age, with real-world solutions we have had decades providing in other areas."
