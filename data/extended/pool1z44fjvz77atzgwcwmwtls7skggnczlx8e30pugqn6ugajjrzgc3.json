			"me": "We're the Pea Farm Stake Pool, introducing a new form of Yield Farming to Cardano called Stake Farming: Put your ADA to work and earn native asset PEA in addition to the regular staking rewards. The total supply is hard capped at 100 million, with a steady issuance rate of 1% per epoch. Funding of development and operations via stake pool revenues - allowing us to distribute the entire PEA supply without premining a single peatoshi."
