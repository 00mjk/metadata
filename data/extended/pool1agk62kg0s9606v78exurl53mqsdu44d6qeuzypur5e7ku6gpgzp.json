			"me": "My name is Anthony and I am running this stake pool with the intention of leaving it for my daughter, Sophi. As she gets older, I hope Cardano also grows to be the source of economic relief for under-developed countries that is has set out to be and then I can tell her that she should be proud to be a part of this process... A part that helped secured the Cardano network and made it possible",
			"server": "A few Amazon Instances with 2 cores, upgradable 100gb SSD Hard Drive, and 8 gigs ram with 8 gig swap. Guaranteed 99.9% up time and the ability to connect to my system from anywhere in the World.",
			"company": "As this pool grows we may add one more pool but I personally do not think growing to any larger than that supports what we are trying to do here with decentralization. We would rather have a full pool that we can take of and loyal delegators... Welcome to SoPHi Stake pool!"
