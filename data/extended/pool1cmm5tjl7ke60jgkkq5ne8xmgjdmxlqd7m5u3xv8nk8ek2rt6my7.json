			"me": "We aspire to be as dedicated as Pierre de Fermat was to his works, in the creation of a fully transparent Cardano staking pool. This includes transparency in the use of epoch rewards we will receive, most of which (if not all) will be re-delegated to the [FERMT] pool, to stimulate pool growth.",
			"server": "We currently have two servers running and plan to increase the amount of nodes in the future to create a resilient network that ensures uptime of our node! All of our servers are enterprise servers that have the highest security standards.",
			"company": "We are a new initiative that thrives to get more out of the staking experience. Why wait, delegate to support us and experience it yourself!"
