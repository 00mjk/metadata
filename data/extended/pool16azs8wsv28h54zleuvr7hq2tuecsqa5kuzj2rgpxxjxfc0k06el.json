			"me": "",
			"server": "Wild ADA operates the Cardano stake pool WILD, running on two-block producers (one for failover), working on bare-metal servers that we own in geo diverse colocations. WILD's relays work on independent cloud providers, with no big-box clouds used for security. At a moment's notice, relays can be scaled-up due to threats, DDoS, or capacity. At any one time, no less than two world-wide relays are working.",
