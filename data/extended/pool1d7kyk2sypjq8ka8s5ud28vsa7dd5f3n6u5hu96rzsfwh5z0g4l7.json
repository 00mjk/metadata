			"me": "Our team consists of three earthlings, who have worked hard to bring Adaliens to our home planet. We hope to build a positive, excited community around the Adalienâs universe, united by our shared love of the Cardano project. With The Scout Teamâs imminent arrival, they will be the first NFTs to be minted. As they collect data and conduct recon, more will surely follow.",
			"server": "We are currently running 3 nodes, one is our block-producing node and it is connected to 2 relays. All 3 nodes are running 24/7 around the clock to ensure maximum uptime in the unlikely event a relay goes offline. The 2 relays' topology file is dynamically updated every 12 hours to ensure they are connected to the most up-to-date list of 19-20 peer relays throughout the decentralised network. This requires a reboot of the relay nodes, so they are staggered so as not to overlap. Every reboot takes the node approximately 10 minutes before it can sync the blockchain from the /db folder, so even within that 1-minute window, the block-producing node is at the very least connected to 1 relay. All nodes are running on Google Cloud with the servers based in the US, using 2 CPUs @ 8GB including a 50GB Ubuntu 20.04 LTS SSD drive for maximum stability. There is also monitoring alerts set up to allow us to rapidly respond to UpTime readings below 1.",
